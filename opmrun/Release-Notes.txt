Release Notes
------------
2020-04.01 - Fixed a tKinter bug that centers windows by the total x-direction display space, rather than the using

           - Added warning message if Pyton 3.7.3 or greater is being used.

           - Changed all Popup messages to have no title bar, grab anywhere, and keep on top options.
           - Moved job parameter manipulation into a separate function get__job function to reduce code duplication,
             as well as to have most of the path manipulation in the one routine.
           - Modified documentation.
           - Re-compiled binary generated tested on Unbuntu-Mate 18-04 and 19-04.

           - Fixed printing bug when OPM Flow terminates with errors.
           - Added windows dialog sizes to OPMRUN.ini file so that user can change the windows size at next re-start.

           - Added projects as shortcut to project directories.
           - Added option to run job queue in foreground (that is under OPMRUN) and background via xterm (should be
             computationally more efficient).
